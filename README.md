# dsv2pulseq

Create Pulseq sequence files from Siemens dsv simulation files

Environment can be installed with provided yml

Sequence should be simulated in transversal orientation with phase-encode direction A->p (which is the default)

Correct orientation currently for Pulseq "old/compat" mode -> WIP: change to XYZ in TRA?
