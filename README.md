Create Pulseq sequence files from Siemens dsv simulation files

Environment can be installed with provided yml

Sequence should be simulated in transversal orientation with phase-encode direction A->P and no FOV shift (which is the default)

Correct orientation currently for Pulseq "XYZ in TRA" mode
